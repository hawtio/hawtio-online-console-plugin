# Hawtio Online OpenShift Console Plugin

A dynamic plugin that integrates the [Hawtio Online](github.com/hawtio/hawtio-online) console into the OpenShift console.

## Development
The plugin can be tested using a local development environment.

### Option 1: Local

In one terminal window, run:

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn run start`

In another terminal window, run:

1. `oc login` (requires [oc](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads) and an [OpenShift cluster](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create))
2. `yarn run start-console` (requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [podman 3.2.0+](https://podman.io))

This will run the OpenShift console in a container connected to the cluster
you've logged into. The plugin HTTP server runs on port 9001 with CORS enabled.
Navigate to <http://localhost:9000/example> to see the running plugin.


#### Running start-console with Apple silicon and podman

If you are using podman on a Mac with Apple silicon, `yarn run start-console`
might fail since it runs an amd64 image. You can workaround the problem with
[qemu-user-static](https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static) by running
these commands:

```bash
podman machine ssh
sudo -i
rpm-ostree install qemu-user-static
systemctl reboot
```

### Option 2: Docker + VSCode Remote Container

Make sure the
[Remote Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
extension is installed. This method uses Docker Compose where one container is
the OpenShift console and the second container is the plugin. It requires that
you have access to an existing OpenShift cluster. After the initial build, the
cached containers will help you start developing in seconds.

1. Create a `dev.env` file inside the `.devcontainer` folder with the correct values for your cluster:

```bash
OC_PLUGIN_NAME=hawtio-online-console-plugin
OC_URL=https://api.example.com:6443
OC_USER=kubeadmin
OC_PASS=<password>
```

2. `(Ctrl+Shift+P) => Remote Containers: Open Folder in Container...`
3. `yarn run start`
4. Navigate to <http://localhost:9000/example>

## Docker image

Before you can deploy your plugin on a cluster, you must build an image and
push it to an image registry.

1. Build the image:

   ```sh
   docker build -t quay.io/my-repository/my-plugin:latest .
   ```

2. Run the image:

   ```sh
   docker run -it --rm -d -p 9001:80 quay.io/my-repository/my-plugin:latest
   ```

3. Push the image:

   ```sh
   docker push quay.io/my-repository/my-plugin:latest
   ```

NOTE: If you have a Mac with Apple silicon, you will need to add the flag
`--platform=linux/amd64` when building the image to target the correct platform
to run in-cluster.

## Deployment on cluster

A [Helm](https://helm.sh) chart is available to deploy the plugin to an OpenShift environment.

The following Helm parameters are required:

`plugin.image`: The location of the image containing the plugin that was previously pushed

Additional parameters can be specified if desired. Consult the chart [values](charts/openshift-console-plugin/values.yaml) file for the full set of supported parameters.

### Installing the Helm Chart

Install the chart using the name of the plugin as the Helm release name into a new namespace or an existing namespace as specified by the `plugin_hawtio-online-console-plugin` parameter and providing the location of the image within the `plugin.image` parameter by using the following command:

```shell
helm upgrade -i  my-plugin charts/openshift-console-plugin -n plugin__hawtio-online-console-plugin --create-namespace --set plugin.image=my-plugin-image-location
```

NOTE: When deploying on OpenShift 4.10, it is recommended to add the parameter `--set plugin.securityContext.enabled=false` which will omit configurations related to Pod Security.

NOTE: When defining i18n namespace, adhere `plugin__<name-of-the-plugin>` format. The name of the plugin should be extracted from the `consolePlugin` declaration within the [package.json](package.json) file.
